# Forcasting_Air_Passengers
## Forecasting Air Passenger Numbers Based on Time Series Data
**Objective:**
The primary objective of this project is to forecast the number of air passengers for future months based on historical time series data. This will help airlines, travel agencies, and related stakeholders make informed decisions about capacity planning, resource allocation, and operational efficiency.

**Description:**
We have a time series dataset with monthly records of the number of passengers traveling by air. The dataset includes:

- Month: A timestamp representing the month and year.
- Passengers: The number of passengers for that month.
The goal is to use historical data to build a predictive model that can accurately forecast future passenger numbers. This involves time series analysis and forecasting techniques to identify patterns, trends, and seasonal effects
